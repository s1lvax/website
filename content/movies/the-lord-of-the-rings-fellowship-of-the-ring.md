## My Review

The Fellowship of the Ring and The Lord of the Rings trilogy are much more than movies, they really are a vibe.

Fellowships starts by introducing us to the world of Middle Earth, with Galadriel's iconic monologue, and from there, the movie takes you on an awesome adventure to Rivendell. 

There is friendship, combat, courage, danger, amusement, and much much more.. What more do you need?

I find myself rewatching the movies over and over again when I have nothing to do at home, they're that good.
