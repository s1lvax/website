## My Review

Pretty basic Jason Statham movie, guy is ex-military and is sent on a mission to save friend's daughter.
Hits every shot while the villains are really incompetent.

What is somewhat different and I liked it is the more deep dive into his life and mental state.

Fun movie if you just want to turn off your brain and have some fun for 2h.
