## My Thoughts

I loved this book and it totally fits into my view on productivity. When you work, work hard, but when you rest, rest without excuse. I've been a fan of Deep Work for a long time and this book talks about it as well.

It also speaks on issues like chaos at work, unorganized jobs, pointless meetings, which I agree with as well.

If you're looking to redefine what productivity is and give up those thoughts of working 75 hours a week, this is the book for you.
