## My Thoughts

Really important book in today's day and age. It changed the way I look at technology, embracing minimalism. 
Because of this book, I am outside more, I quit social media, I'm more productive and I'm happier.
If you feel like technology is no longer making a positive impact in your life, this is the book for you. 

The only issue I have and why I didn't give it a rating of 5/5 is because of the pace. I believe that, in some instances, Mr. Newport repeats himself and lingers on a point for a tad bit too long.

All in all, an excellent book.
