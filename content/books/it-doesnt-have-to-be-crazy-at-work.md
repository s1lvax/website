## My Thoughts

Informative book about a different work philosophy. 

The book argues that it doesn't have to be stressful, or as they say, "crazy" at work. With some simple steps, every company could be a much better place to work.

Definitely recommend it, specially if you're a Project Manager or a Business Owner.
