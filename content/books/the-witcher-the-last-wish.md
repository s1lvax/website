## My Thoughts

I am a huge fan of [The Witcher 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Witcher_3:_Wild_Hunt) so it sparked the curiosity in me to read the books as well.

The is the first one and honestly it's pretty cool. We follow Geralt of Rivia in his adventures, which are always interesting and have some really cool twists and turns. Sometimes, it even goes deep into topics like morality, etc..

Loved this one and after reading, immediately bought the second one.
