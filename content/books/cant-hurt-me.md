## My Thoughts

One of the books that truly changed my life. I listened to it during the COVID lockdowns.

Because of the lockdowns, I got lazy and unwell. David Goggins and his book "Can't Hurt Me" really helped me get off my feet and get to work. I started running and taking sports serious. 

This also allowed me to get some much needed fresh air during the lockdowns. 

If you're feeling depressed, I wholeheartedly recommend it.

Thank you, David.
