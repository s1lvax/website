## My Thoughts

Like the first one, it's a pretty fun book. Here we finally get introduced to really cool characters that follow Geralt of Rivia for the rest of the series, which are really interesting.

The monsters are always pretty intriguing and the world building is cool, although it certainly helps that I have the visuals of the game in my brain.
