## My Thoughts

The first Red Rising book was absolutely amazing. I loved all the characters, especially Darrow.

The story was captivating and intriguing, the world building was spot on and it left me waiting more. The plot twists were on point and caught me off guard. There were countless moments that I spent laughing and waiting to find out more about the story.

I already started reading the second book.
