<h2 id="my-review">My Review</h2>
<p>This film centers on a jury of 12 men who must decide the verdict in the case of an 18-year-old defendant. After the evidence is presented, the jurors are sequestered in a room to deliberate the young man&rsquo;s fate. If found guilty, he will be sentenced to death by the electric chair.</p>
<p>When the initial vote is taken, eleven jurors vote guilty. Only one, Juror #8, who we later learn is named Mr. Davis, votes not guilty.</p>
<p>The entirety of the film unfolds within the confines of this single room. Slowly but surely, Mr. Davis challenges the others&rsquo; certainty, forcing them to confront their own biases and re-examine the evidence. He methodically convinces them that there is reasonable doubt about the young man&rsquo;s guilt.</p>

<p>The atmosphere of conflict is perfectly portrayed, the acting is phenomenal, and the conclusion is immensely satisfying. Despite what might seem like a static premise, the movie is never boring or tedious.</p>
<p>Each man in the room represents a different human flaw and prejudice. The film explores themes of childhood trauma, racism, and the eagerness of some to condemn a young man without a second thought. It handles these complex social issues with a depth and thoughtfulness that is often missing in contemporary cinema. &ldquo;12 Angry Men&rdquo; provides profound insight into our inner biases, demonstrating that thoughtful commentary on social injustice existed in film long before the modern era.</p>
