    <p>Over the past few days, I’ve been working with Next.js on a project at my company. It’s one of my first serious experiences with the framework. I had briefly tried it before, but chose Svelte instead when working with TypeScript. These days, I prefer Ruby on Rails 8.
Now that I’ve spent some time building real features with what many call the most popular framework in the world, I honestly can’t understand why it’s so mainstream.</p>
