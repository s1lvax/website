      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past few days, I’ve been working with Next.js on a project at my company. It’s one of my first serious experiences with the framework. I had briefly tried it before, but chose Svelte instead when working with TypeScript. These days, I prefer Ruby on Rails 8.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now that I’ve spent some time building real features with what many call the most popular framework in the world, I honestly can’t understand why it’s so mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-thoughts&#34;&gt;My Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first Red Rising book was absolutely amazing. I loved all the characters, especially Darrow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The story was captivating and intriguing, the world building was spot on and it left me waiting more. The plot twists were on point and caught me off guard. There were countless moments that I spent laughing and waiting to find out more about the story.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I already started reading the second book.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-thoughts&#34;&gt;My Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I loved this book and it totally fits into my view on productivity. When you work, work hard, but when you rest, rest without excuse. I&amp;rsquo;ve been a fan of Deep Work for a long time and this book talks about it as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It also speaks on issues like chaos at work, unorganized jobs, pointless meetings, which I agree with as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re looking to redefine what productivity is and give up those thoughts of working 75 hours a week, this is the book for you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-review&#34;&gt;My Review&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This film centers on a jury of 12 men who must decide the verdict in the case of an 18-year-old defendant. After the evidence is presented, the jurors are sequestered in a room to deliberate the young man&amp;rsquo;s fate. If found guilty, he will be sentenced to death by the electric chair.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the initial vote is taken, eleven jurors vote guilty. Only one, Juror #8, who we later learn is named Mr. Davis, votes not guilty.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How My Love for Tech Pushed Me to Digital Minimalism</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-love-for-technology&#34;&gt;My Love for Technology&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From the earliest days I can remember, my passion for technology, electronics, and engineering was ever-present. I recall sitting at my father’s old ASUS laptop before I even knew how to write, meticulously typing out a short password from memory. It was my gateway to exploration and discovery.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of my fondest memories is playing Windows Pinball with my dad for hours. It’s a memory that brings a smile to my face even now. He was exceptional at the game, and it only added to the hero-like image I had of him. Then came the day we somehow got &lt;em&gt;GTA San Andreas&lt;/em&gt; installed on that laptop. It marked a new era of excitement—I would game for just an hour a day, but that hour was sacred. Every moment felt fleeting, filled with the sheer thrill of getting unlimited money with cheat codes, strapping on a jetpack, and causing havoc atop the San Andreas hospital. It wasn’t just gaming—it was a ritual after a long day at school, a reward that came only after spending time socializing and connecting with my friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
