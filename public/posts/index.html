    <p>My Love for Technology From the earliest days I can remember, my passion for technology, electronics, and engineering was ever-present. I recall sitting at my father’s old ASUS laptop before I even knew how to write, meticulously typing out a short password from memory. It was my gateway to exploration and discovery.
One of my fondest memories is playing Windows Pinball with my dad for hours. It’s a memory that brings a smile to my face even now.</p>
